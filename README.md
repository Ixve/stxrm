# stxrm Selfbot
Make sure to put your token inside stxrm.py, in the field found at top. The proxycheck and AbuseIPDB API keys are optional and are meant to be used with the `proxycheck` command.

The default prefix is `>>`, you can list all the commands via `>>commands` where they will be printed in console.

Please note this is a W.I.P. selfbot and quality isn't guaranteed as I am doing this simply out of boredom.
