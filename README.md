# ⛈ stxrm Selfbot ⛈
<pre>
Make sure to put your token inside stxrm.py, in the field found at top.
The proxycheck and AbuseIPDB API keys are optional and are meant to be used with the `proxycheck` command.

The default prefix is `>>`
You can list all the commands via `>>commands` where they will be printed in console.

Please note this is a W.I.P. selfbot and quality isn't guaranteed as I am doing this simply out of boredom.

If you want a good free selfbot check out Ghost (click below to be taken to its GitHub)</pre>

If you're receiving a intent related error, downgrade discord.py
I cannot be bothered to fix the error right now

To downgrade run: `pip install --upgrade discord.py==1.7.3`






I am not responsible for anything you do with this selfbot.
